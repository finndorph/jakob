#summary Describes the configuration format

This is the initial proposal for a internal configuration format used in JAKOB, in  order to get attributes from different sources
= Example =
{{{
<job ID="cdsfvvwedv" name="Hent attributter">
  <task order="1" >
    <connector name="CPR">
      <options>
        <option name="uid">ndlksvfv</option>
      </options>   
    </connector>
  </task>
  <batch order="2" >
    <task>
      <connector name="VIP">
        <options>
          <option name="uid">ndlksvfv</option>
        </options>   
      </connector>
    </task>
    <task>
      <connector name="CLUR">
        <options>
          <option name="uid">ndlksvfv</option>
        </options>   
      </connector>
    </task>
  </batch>
</job>
}}}
