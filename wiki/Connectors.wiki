#summary Connector design

=Writing a connector for JAKOB=
To write a JKOB connector you must implement a class the implements the `Connector` interface. The actual implementation of the connector must be placed in the `<JAKOB-DIR>/lib/WAYF/Connector/` directory

==Connector interface==
{{{
interface Connector
{
    /**
     * Default method called by worker
     * @param \GearmanJob $job Job Gearman job
     */
    public function execute(\GearmanJob $job);

    public function setStore(\WAYF\Store $store);

    public function setConfig(array $config);

    public function setup();
}
}}}

Please note that this interface is still under development, so it may change in the future.
